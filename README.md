How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure by using testing techniques to test my software correctly, such as black box testing or white box testing techniques. To ensure it is secure, I can implement security measures such as encryption if I want to get serious, but really keeping all my files zipped and safe on my laptop, secured with a password and kept in safe areas, allows me to keep it generally safe. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To interpret user needs, you have to put yourself in the shoes of the user, asking yourself questions such as "If I wanted to use this, what would I want to be accessible to me?" a lot of the time, they want things to be easy. Researching user needs and wants, along with modern trends helps with this. 

How do I approach designing software?
Do a lot of research, study, and start slow. Start with small projects and work your way up. Always ask for help.
